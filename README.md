# n2k

n2k is an R package that facilitates working with the Dutch implementation of
regulations regarding Natura 2000 nature conservation areas.

At this point, the package provides only little code that is of interest to
others. The main reason for publishing it on github is to gauge interest in a
more complete package. Please contact me if you are interested.
